# NkLIB: Nekso's common Erlang library functions

NkLIB includes a serie of common utilities and services for NkCORE, but probably useful for other applications:
* Quick parsers for uris, tokens, schemes, etc.
* Yet another process registry.
* A flexible in-memory database with TTLs.
* Counters management service.
* Header manipulation.
